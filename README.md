# svadataviz-week2
Data visualization of my transportation for the week of September 13 through September 20 

I kept a Google Form beginning on Thursday evening, September 13 through Thursday morning, September 20 for all my travels. 
I had a total 73 responses. 
After gathering those responses in a Google Sheet, I started by mapping the responses into categories. After mapping all the data, I separated the data by day. 
Following that, I duplicated my data responses and created another sheet to match my data to fit the categories that I created.
Once I did that, I created a legend and drew my data visualization.
I have attached the files to show my process and my final data visualization!

In the process of creating my data visualization I had the oppportunity to learn about my process, in hindsight, I would used standard language to talk about my starting and ending points (i.e. train station instead of 14 street and 6th ave L station) and I would have created more drop downs for my Google Form to help make my data more clean to read. 

As a whole the data definitely represented my lifestyle beyond this week, I walk more than any other transport mode. I start my days early and have late nights, I also spend (way too much) time at train stations commuting between the boroughs for work, school, and classes.
